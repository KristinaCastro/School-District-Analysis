# School-District-Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the school board with an evaluation of reading and math grades for schools in the school district. Due to evidence of academic dishonesty, we're asked to go back to our original school district analysis and omit Thomas High School's ninth grade reading and math grades. Once the math and reading scores have been removed, we will be revising our analysis to reflect the update data and providing a report to describe how omitting the 9th grade Thomas high school data affects the overall analysis.
